# Subscription System Implementation

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Database Schema
- ✅ Created `subscriptions` table with tier, credits, and renewal tracking
- ✅ Created `usage_logs` table for tracking credit usage
- ✅ Implemented PostgreSQL functions for:
  - Auto-creating subscriptions for new users
  - Checking available credits
  - Deducting credits after generation
  - Upgrading subscription tiers
  - Auto-resetting credits based on cycle (daily/monthly)
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection

### 2. Subscription Tiers
| Tier | Price | Credits | Reset Cycle | Features |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | 3/day | Daily | Quick mode only |
| **Creator** | $19/mo | 1000/month | Monthly | Quick + Director modes |
| **Director** | $49/mo | 3000/month | Monthly | Quick + Director modes + Priority support |

### 3. React Context & Hooks
- ✅ `SubscriptionContext` - Global subscription state management
- ✅ `useSubscription` hook with:
  - `subscription` - Current subscription data
  - `hasCredits()` - Check if user has enough credits
  - `canUseDirectorMode()` - Check director mode access
  - `deductCredits()` - Deduct credits after generation
  - `upgradeSubscription()` - Upgrade to new tier
  - `refreshSubscription()` - Reload subscription data

### 4. UI Components

#### SubscriptionBadge
- Visual tier indicator with gradient colors
- Shows user's subscription level
- Sizes: sm, md, lg
- Icons: ⚪️ Free, ⚡️ Creator, 🎥 Director

#### UsageCounter
- Real-time credit usage display
- Progress bar with color coding:
  - Green: >50% remaining
  - Yellow: 20-50% remaining
  - Red: <20% remaining
- Shows renewal date and cycle

#### UpgradeModal
- Triggered when:
  - Credits exhausted
  - Director mode locked (Free users)
  - Frequent usage detected
- Side-by-side tier comparison
- Feature lists for each tier
- One-click upgrade button

#### SubscriptionPlans
- Full subscription management page
- 3-column tier comparison
- Current plan indicator
- Upgrade buttons
- Feature comparison

### 5. Integration Points

#### Dashboard
- Added UsageCounter display for logged-in users
- UpgradeModal integration
- Subscription checks before generation:
  1. Check if director mode is allowed
  2. Check if credits available
  3. Show upgrade modal if needed
  4. Deduct credits after successful generation

#### Sidebar
- Added "Subscription" menu item
- Navigates to subscription management page

#### Generation Flow
```typescript
handleGenerate() {
  // 1. Check director mode access
  if (mode === 'director' && !canUseDirectorMode()) {
    showUpgradeModal('director_locked');
    return;
  }

  // 2. Check credits
  if (!hasCredits()) {
    showUpgradeModal('credits_out');
    return;
  }

  // 3. Generate prompt
  const prompt = await generateSoraPrompt(...);

  // 4. Deduct credits
  await deductCredits(prompt.id, mode);
}
```

### 6. Internationalization (i18n)
Added translations for Chinese and English:
- Tier names and pricing
- Feature descriptions
- Upgrade modal messages
- Usage counter labels
- Button text

Translation keys:
```typescript
sidebarSubscription
subscriptionTitle
subscriptionCurrent
tierFree, tierCreator, tierDirector
tierFreePrice, tierCreatorPrice, tierDirectorPrice
upgradeModalTitle
upgradeModalCreditsOut
upgradeModalFrequentUse
upgradeModalDirectorLocked
...
```

### 7. Auto-Reset Logic
Credits automatically reset via PostgreSQL function:
- **Free**: Daily at UTC 00:00
- **Creator**: Monthly on the 1st at UTC 00:00
- **Director**: Monthly on the 1st at UTC 00:00

Reset happens automatically when checking credits via `check_credits()` function.

## 📊 Database Functions

### `check_credits(p_user_id, p_cost)`
- Checks if user has enough credits
- Auto-resets if renewal_date has passed
- Returns boolean

### `deduct_credits(p_user_id, p_prompt_id, p_mode, p_cost)`
- Checks credits first
- Deducts credits from subscription
- Logs usage in usage_logs table
- Returns boolean

### `upgrade_subscription(p_user_id, p_new_tier)`
- Updates subscription tier
- Resets credits to new tier amount
- Updates renewal date
- Returns boolean

## 🎯 User Flow Examples

### Free User Trying Director Mode
1. User selects "Director Mode"
2. System checks `canUseDirectorMode()` → false
3. UpgradeModal appears with reason: "director_locked"
4. Shows Creator and Director options
5. User clicks "Upgrade to Creator"
6. Subscription upgraded, credits reset to 1000
7. Director mode unlocked

### User Running Out of Credits
1. User generates 3rd prompt of the day (Free tier)
2. System checks `hasCredits()` → false
3. UpgradeModal appears with reason: "credits_out"
4. User can:
   - Upgrade immediately
   - Wait for next day (daily reset)

### Successful Generation Flow
1. User enters prompt
2. System checks mode permission ✓
3. System checks credits (2/3 remaining) ✓
4. Prompt generates successfully
5. Credits deducted (1/3 remaining)
6. UsageCounter updates in real-time

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Users can only view/update own subscription
   - Users can only view own usage logs

2. **Database Functions**
   - All credit operations via secure functions
   - SECURITY DEFINER for controlled access
   - No direct table updates from client

3. **Auth Integration**
